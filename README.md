This a program to play the Tower of Hanoi. This project contains only one C file. Just
download it, compile and run using Dev Compiler. Enable the speakers in the system

When you run this program you can see the welcome screen with three options such as
‘start game’, ‘display rules’, ‘exit’. For the first time, go through the rules. Press any key
to return from rules. Then start playing the game after choosing the level. In level 1 you
have three disks. In level n you have n+2 disks to play with.

On the game screen you can specify the FROM-ROD and TO-ROD, possible values are
A, B, C and should be given in upper case. If given AB, a disk from A is moved to B.
The invalid moves will reduce the life and a player has only three life. The entries other
than A, B, C and the transfer to the same rod like BB are considered as invalid move.
The life left will be displayed on the screen.

When you transfer all the disks from A rod to the C rod by obeying the rules, then you
won the game. One who transfers with minimum moves and without losing life will get
maximum score.

the main menu. Then you can continue playing or exit from game.
